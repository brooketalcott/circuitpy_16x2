#CircuitPy_16x2
##16x2 display module for circutpython

I was looking to use a 16x2 LCD screen with my raspberry pico and like lordrippon I was looking for a simple wiring setup and lacked a backpack for my pico. 

A few of my pico project components are using circutpython instead of microPython though so some of the modules needed to be replaced for compatability

And why not see if I can't make this API a little easier to use?
